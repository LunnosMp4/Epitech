# My Hunter

## Graphical Programming

Hunter is a simple game where you have to shoot ducks, it is developed in C and with CSFML library. It was my very first graphical project and I had a lot of fun doing it (it's buggy but it's fun).

You will just have to click on ducks that appear on screen to increase score. The game become more complex when you reach a certain score.

Warning this game contains graphic content, it may not be suitable for all audiences. (I'm kidding, it's just ducks, it may have a little bit of blood but it's not that bad).

Enjoy!
