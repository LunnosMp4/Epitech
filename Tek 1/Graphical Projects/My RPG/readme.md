# My RPG

## Graphical Programming

RPG is the final graphical project from my 1st year with the 42sh, it was for me the funniest project and it was very cool having that much time (4 month) too create an RPG games, we were 4 on this project and we had a lot of fun doing it.

I will not spoil you the story of the game, it was made with our hearts ! I can just tell you that it involves anime characters and Poutine (yes the russian guy) I promise it's not political.

We didn't have the time to polish the game as much as we wanted but we are still proud of it because we had a lot of project in parallel at that time and we still managed to do something and had the 3rd best game of the promotion.

I hope you will enjoy it as much as we did doing it.
