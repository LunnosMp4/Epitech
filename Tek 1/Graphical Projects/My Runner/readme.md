# My Runner

## Graphical programming

Runner is a simple game where you play as a fox and you have to jump hover logs. It is developed in C and with CSFML library for graphical part.

The game is very simple, you just have to press space to jump and avoid logs. The game become more complex when you reach a certain score. The mechanic is the same as the dinosaur game from google.

THis game is a little bugged and was my second game however I had fun doing it, and I really like the graphics of this one with a nice parralax effect in the background.

Enjoy!
