# How To Play

Here is a quick guide on how to use the Arcade.

First you will have to launch the Arcade. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
./arcade lib/arcade_sdl2.so
```

The first argument is the graphical library to use per default.

### In Menu

You can change the graphical library at runtime by choosing one from the menu.

In order to do that use the `Arrow keys` to navigate the menu and the `Enter` key to select an option.

You can use any graphical library or game library (while ingame) that is located in the `lib` directory.

### In Game

Here are the controls when you are in game:

- `Z` to go up
- `S` to go down
- `Q` to go left
- `D` to go right

- `A` to go to the previous graphical library
- `E` to go to the next graphical library

- `Space` to restart the game
- `Backspace` to go back to the menu (quit the game)
- `Escape` to quit the program
