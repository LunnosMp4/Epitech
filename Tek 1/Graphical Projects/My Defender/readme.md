# My Defender

## Graphical Programming

Defender is a tower defense game, it is developed in C and with CSFML library for graphical part as well as the other projects in this directory.

The game is very simple, you have to place turrets to shot tanks before they arrive at the end of the road.

You can create your own custom map, for this you will need to create a new file in `assets/map/` with the name like level-x where x is the number of the level. It will play all the levels in order.

To create the map you can take a look at the original map to see how they are formatted.

Enjoy!
