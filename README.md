Most interesting project will be Area / R-Type, both took 3 months to complete. They were made in a team of 4/5 people.<br>
The first one is an IFTTT application for mobile / web with a database, a back-end / front-end.<br>
The second one is a 3D Graphic Engine with multiplayer capabilities. It is demonstrated with the reproduction of the R-Type in 3D and with network multiplayer.
