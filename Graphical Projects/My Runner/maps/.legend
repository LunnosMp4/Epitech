The map is made up of 20 points. Each point represents 50 pixels so the map is 1000 pixels long.
The x represents an enemy and the o a second enemy.
If you place several x or o the game will only take into account the first one in the map.
You can also change the difficulty while changing the speed of the logs.
For doing this you must change the value after 'D:'. Default value is 1
Enjoy the game !
